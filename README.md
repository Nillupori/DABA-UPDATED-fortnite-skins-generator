The first square in the random generator will show you a Fortnite outfit, such as 'Dark priestess Naomi', 'Shadowbird', 'Slurp Jonesy' or even 'Holly Striker' and 'Aloy'. There are quite a lot of them, and most of them are really awesome.

A glider is the tool you use after making the jump out of the party bus. The second square in the random generator will show you the Fortnite glider you can use, a few examples of them are: 'Fennecâ€™s ship', 'Wolf kissed longboat', 'First order tie fighter' and 'Batglider'.

Random Fortnite back bling
The back bling (back pack) is just a cosmetic item within Fortnite. There will be no benefit from it, besides that it looks cool when it's on the back of your character. You can really make a big entrance while carrying the 'Sweet spikes', â€˜Wavepiercer' or the 'Dark paradigm'. You will find your random back bling in the third square.

Random Fortnite pickaxe
Pickaxes are used as a harvesting tool. You can demolish all different materials and you can use it against your enemies when you're out of ammo. Not only does the pickaxe look very cool while taking down an entire building wall by wall, it also does finish your character's looks. Some of the axes like 'Spider snare', 'Mello mallets', 'Zen axe' or 'Stun rod' are very rare or even legendary, but therefore are some of the best looking axes in the game. Your pickaxe will show up in the fourth square after generating the items.

Random Fortnite skydiving trail
A skydiving trail is just like the back bling a cosmetic item. There will be no benefit from it, but nonetheless very cool to show off with. Most of the skydiving trails are 'uncommon' or 'rare' as you probably know but there are some hidden charms among them, for instance 'Portal particles', 'Beachballs', 'lava' and 'Symbiote trail'. Your skydiving trail is visible in the fifth square.

Random Fortnite wrap
A wrap is also just a cosmetic item, but wraps will give you a little bit more benefit within the game. Wraps will change the way your weapons and vehicles behave, and will give you that little bit of extra personal flavor in the world of Fortnite, my personal favourites are 'X insignia', 'callsign hornet', 'Finfin flair' and last but definitely not least 'Galactic carnaval'. The last square will show you your random Fortnite wrap.
